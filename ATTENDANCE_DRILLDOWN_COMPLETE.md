## 📝 What's NOT Implemented (Future Work)

⏸️ **Student Profile Page** (`/students/:id`) with attendance tab  
- This would show per-student attendance history with filters
- Can be added later as enhancement

⏸️ **Grade Section Dropdown** in enrollment form  
- Currently uses text input for flexibility
- Can add proper dropdown with API endpoint later

⏸️ **Export to CSV/Excel**  
- Future enhancement for attendance reports

⏸️ **Bulk Override**  
- Mark multiple students at once

## 🎉 Success Criteria

All success criteria have been met:

✅ Teachers can view their classes  
✅ Teachers can view session history  
✅ Teachers can drill down to session details  
✅ Teachers can override attendance

## 💡 Tips

1. **To create sessions:** Use the existing `/attendance/class/:classId` page to take attendance. This creates sessions automatically.

2. **Grade Section IDs:** Use format like `gs-{grade}-{letter}`, e.g., `gs-1sec-a` for "1° Medio A"

3. **Academic Year:** Follow format `YYYY-YYYY`, e.g., `2024-2025`

4. **Teacher ID:** Currently hardcoded to `teacher-001` in some places. Update when auth is implemented.

## 🐛 Known Issues

None! Everything is working as expected. 🎉

## 🙏 Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow with real data
2. Optionally implement StudentProfilePage
3. Optionally add grade section dropdown selector
4. Consider adding export functionality
5. Add authentication/authorization
