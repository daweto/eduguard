# Class-Based Attendance System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive class-based attendance system that allows teachers to log attendance for their classes by taking multiple photos of the classroom. The system now supports:

- Teachers teaching multiple classes
- Students enrolled in different classes
- Multi-photo attendance capture (1-10 photos per session)
- Automatic face recognition scoring and attendance tracking
- Complete session and attendance record management

## 🔌 Backend API Endpoints

### Classes API (`/api/classes`)

1. **GET `/api/classes/teacher/:teacherId`**
   - Returns all classes taught by a specific teacher
   - Includes course, classroom, and enrollment count
   - Response: `{ teacher_id, classes[], total }`

2. **GET `/api/classes/:classId/students`**
   - Returns all enrolled students for a specific class
   - Includes student info, guardian info, and face count
   - Response: `{ class, students[], total }`

3. **GET `/api/classes/:classId`**
   - Returns detailed information about a specific class
   - Includes course, classroom, and teacher details

### Enhanced Attendance API (`/api/attendance`)

**NEW: POST `/api/attendance/session`**

- Create attendance session with 1-10 photos
- Processes all photos and aggregates detected faces
- Creates session record and individual attendance records
- Compares detected students against enrolled students
- Returns present/absent lists with confidence scores

**Request:**

```json
{
  "class_id": "class-math-1m-a",
  "teacher_id": "teacher-001",
  "photos": ["base64_1", "base64_2", ...],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T08:15:00Z"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "session_id": "session-xyz",
  "class_id": "class-math-1m-a",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T08:15:00Z",
  "photos_processed": 3,
  "expected_students": 30,
  "present_count": 24,
  "absent_count": 6,
  "present_students": [...],
  "absent_students": [...],
  "total_faces_detected": 28
}
```

## 🎨 Frontend Pages & Components

### New Pages

1. **`TeacherClassesPage`** (`/classes`)
   - Displays all classes taught by the teacher
   - Shows class info: course name, section, period, time
   - Shows classroom location and enrollment count
   - "Tomar Asistencia" button for each class

2. **`ClassAttendancePage`** (`/attendance/class/:classId`)
   - Photo capture interface (1-10 photos)
   - Shows enrolled students list
   - Processes photos and displays results
   - Shows present/absent students with confidence scores
   - Allows retaking attendance

### New Hooks

1. **`useTeacherClasses(teacherId)`**
   - Fetches all classes for a teacher
   - Returns: `{ classes, isLoading, error }`

2. **`useClassStudents(classId)`**
   - Fetches all enrolled students for a class
   - Returns: `{ classData, isLoading, error, refetch }`

### Updated Routes

- Default route now redirects to `/classes`
- Added `/classes` - Teacher classes list
- Added `/attendance/class/:classId` - Take attendance for a class

## 📊 Data Model Architecture

### Course vs Class Distinction

- **`courses`** = Template/master definition (e.g., "MATH101")
  - Defines curriculum, subject, credits
  - Reused across academic years

- **`classes`** = Specific section instance (e.g., "MATH101 - Section A")
  - References a course template
  - Has specific teacher, classroom, period, time
  - Multiple sections can share the same course

### Enrollment Flow

1. **Course** is created (MATH101 - Introduction to Algebra)
2. **Class** section is created (MATH101-A, taught by María González in Room A1, Period 1)
3. **Students** are enrolled in the class section
4. **Teacher** takes attendance for the class session
5. **Session** is created with photos
6. **Attendance** records are created for each enrolled student

### Example Scenario

**Teacher**: María González (teacher-001)

- Teaches: Math Section A (Period 1) and Physics Section A (Period 3)

**Students**: Sofía, Diego, Catalina

- All enrolled in Math Section A and Physics Section A

**Workflow**:

1. Teacher opens app → sees "Mis Clases"
2. Selects "Matemática I - Sección A"
3. Takes 1-10 photos of classroom
4. System processes photos via AWS Rekognition
5. System matches faces to enrolled students
6. System creates session record
7. System creates attendance records (present/absent for each student)
8. Teacher sees results: 2 present, 1 absent
