# 🗣️ 60-second pitch (memorize this)

> **Problem**
> Every class, teachers lose minutes taking attendance — and schools often discover truancy late. Parents get notified after the fact, not when it matters.
>
> **Solution**
> We built **EduGuard**, an AI attendance & safety agent. The teacher takes a single classroom photo. Our vision agent recognizes students instantly, marks attendance, and our reasoning agent spots risky patterns. If a student is likely skipping, a **voice AI agent calls the parent in Spanish**, confirms the situation with one keypress, and sends a WhatsApp summary — all in under a minute.
>
> **Why now / why us**
> Face embeddings run **in the browser** for privacy; the backend runs entirely on **Cloudflare** — Vectorize for embeddings, D1 for logs, Queues for notifications, and Twilio for voice. No hardware changes, zero manual roll-call.
>
> **Impact**
> We save teachers time every period, give admins real-time visibility, and involve families before small attendance issues become big ones.
>
> **Demo**
> In our demo, a class photo recognized 6 students, flagged one repeated absence, auto-called the parent, captured their response, and updated the dashboard live. That’s **AI that acts**, not just chats.
