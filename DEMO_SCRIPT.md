---

## 🎯 Opening (30 seconds)

**[Slide: Problem Statement]**

> "Imagine this: It's 9 AM. Sofia Martinez was in English class first period. By math class second period, she's gone. She's snuck off campus. 
> 
> With traditional systems, her teachers won't notice. Her parents won't find out for days.
>
> We built EduGuard to solve this in **under 10 seconds**."

**[Transition to live demo]**

## 🤖 Act 1: Vision Agent (1 minute)

**[Screen: Teacher Classes Dashboard]**

> "I'm a teacher. I open EduGuard on my phone. Here are my classes today."

**[Click: "Matemáticas - Sección A"]**

> "I'm teaching Math, Period 2. 30 students enrolled. I'll take attendance now."

**[Click: "Tomar Asistencia" (Take Attendance)]**

**[Phone camera opens - show classroom photo]**

> "Instead of calling names for 10 minutes, I take one photo."

**[Snap photo, show upload progress]**

> "Watch the top right - we're uploading to AWS Rekognition, our Vision Agent."

**[Results appear: 24 faces detected]**

> "In 2 seconds, AWS identified 24 students. 98% accuracy. That's our first AI agent - the Vision Agent."

**[Scroll through detected students]**

> "Green checkmarks - present. Notice Sofia Martinez? She's marked absent."

---

## 🧠 Act 2: Reasoning Agent (1.5 minutes)

**[Point to Sofia's card with 🚨 HIGH RISK badge]**

> "But here's where it gets interesting. See this red badge? That's our second agent - the Reasoning Agent.
>
> It's not just marking her absent. It's thinking."

**[Click on Sofia's card to expand details]**

**[Shows risk analysis panel:]**
```
⚠️ HIGH RISK DETECTED
Pattern: Sneak-Out
Confidence: 89%

Today's Pattern:
✅ Period 1 (English): PRESENT (99.2% confidence)
❌ Period 2 (Math): ABSENT

AI Analysis:
"Student was present in first period but absent in 
subsequent period. This pattern indicates possible 
unauthorized mid-day departure. Immediate parent 
notification recommended."
```

> "Our Reasoning Agent is GPT-4. It analyzed Sofia's attendance:
> - Present Period 1
> - Absent Period 2
>
> This is the exact pattern of a sneak-out. The AI detected it automatically.
>
> Traditional systems would never catch this - teachers only see their own class. But our AI sees the full picture."

**[Point to "Call Parent" button]**

> "And here's the magic. This button triggers our third agent."

---

## 📞 Act 3: Voice Agent (2 minutes)

**[Click: "Call Parent" button]**

**[Modal appears: "Initiating call to guardian..."]**

> "This is calling ElevenLabs, our Voice Agent. It's a conversational AI that will call Sofia's mom in Spanish."

**[Show call status: "Connecting..."]**

**[If live demo works:]**

> "I'm going to put this on speaker."

**[Phone rings on speaker]**

**[Natural Conversational AI speaks in Spanish:]**
```
AI Agent (natural voice): 
  "Hola, buenos días. Soy el asistente virtual del Colegio San José.
   ¿Hablo con María, la mamá de Sofia Martinez?"

Parent (SPEAKING naturally): 
  "Sí, soy yo."

AI Agent: 
  "Le llamo para informarle que Sofia no ha asistido a clases hoy.
   ¿Está usted al tanto de esta ausencia?"

Parent (SPEAKING): 
  "¿Qué? ¡No tenía idea! Ella salió esta mañana para el colegio."

AI Agent (adapts to alarmed tone):
  "Entiendo su preocupación. Sofia no fue detectada en ninguna clase.
   Un administrador del colegio se pondrá en contacto con usted
   inmediatamente. ¿Hay algo más que pueda ayudarle?"

Parent (SPEAKING): 
  "No, voy a buscarla ahora. Gracias por avisar."

AI Agent: 
  "Por favor manténganos informados. Que encuentre a Sofia pronto.
   Que tenga buen día."

[Call ends naturally - 72 seconds total]
```

**[Call ends - UI updates with AI analysis:]**
```
✅ Call Completed
Duration: 72 seconds
Transcript: "¿Qué? ¡No tenía idea! Ella salió esta mañana..."
Sentiment: Alarmed
Parent Awareness: FALSE ⚠️
Parent Action: Will search for student
Urgency: HIGH - Administrator alerted
```

> "Notice - this wasn't a robotic menu. The AI had a REAL conversation in Spanish.
> It understood the parent's alarm, adapted its tone, and captured the key info:
> The parent didn't know. That's a safety emergency.
>
> From classroom photo to parent's phone: **8 seconds**.
>
> That's three AI agents working together:
> 1. Vision Agent identified faces
> 2. Reasoning Agent detected the pattern
> 3. Voice Agent called the parent
>
> Automatically."

## 💡 Closing: The Bigger Picture (30 seconds)

**[Slide: Impact Summary]**

> "This isn't just faster attendance. This is student safety.
>
> 30% of truancy happens mid-day. Parents find out days later. By then, the student could be anywhere.
>
> With EduGuard:
> - **2 seconds** for attendance vs 10 minutes
> - **Real-time** sneak-out detection
> - **Immediate** parent notification in their language
>
> We're using AI the way it should be used - not replacing teachers, but protecting students.
>
> Thank you."

## 📊 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the photo is blurry?**
> "AWS Rekognition has built-in quality filtering. If it can't get a confident match (below 95%), it flags for manual review. Teachers can always override."

**Q: What about privacy concerns?**
> "Great question. We only store facial embeddings, not raw photos. Parents opt-in during enrollment. And teachers can see exactly what data is being sent."

**Q: How much does this cost?**
> "AWS Rekognition: $5-10/month for a typical school. GPT-4: ~$20/month. ElevenLabs: $0.10/call. Total: under $50/month for a 500-student school. Compare that to one security incident prevented."

**Q: What if a student doesn't have enrollment photos?**
> "The system shows them as 'unable to verify' and the teacher manually marks them, just like traditional attendance. But 95% of students will have photos within the first week."

**Q: Why use conversational AI instead of a recorded message?**
> "Great question! ElevenLabs Conversational AI lets parents SPEAK naturally, not press buttons. If a parent is driving, cooking, or stressed, they can just talk. The AI understands 'Sí, está enfermo' or '¿Qué? ¡No sabía!' - it's empathetic and adapts. That's crucial for parents in crisis."

**Q: Can students trick the system with photos?**
> "AWS Rekognition includes liveness detection. And realistically, if a student goes through that effort, the teacher would notice. This isn't airport security - it's assistance for teachers."

**Q: Why three separate agents instead of one big model?**
> "Separation of concerns. Vision needs to be fast (2s). Reasoning can take longer (3s). Voice needs to be conversational. Each agent is optimized for its job. Plus it's more debuggable and maintainable."

**Q: What if parents don't answer the call?**
> "The system leaves a voicemail and sends an SMS. Then flags for the administrator to follow up. We're building redundancy into the notification pipeline."

**Q: Can this work in other languages besides Spanish?**
> "Absolutely. ElevenLabs supports 29 languages. We started with Spanish because that's the primary language at our pilot school, but it's configurable."
